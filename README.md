# React Todo List Application

This project is a lab exercise to build a Todo List application using React. It demonstrates the use of state management with `useReducer` or `useState`, controlled forms, and conditional rendering.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Learn to manage state with `useReducer` and/or `useImmerReducer`.
- Understand where to use `useState` in state management.
- Implement controlled forms and inputs.
- Decide effectively where different pieces of state should live.
- Use conditional rendering and styling for a dynamic user experience.
- Create a complete React application from scratch.

## Instructions

This lab will test your ability to build an application from the ground up, using a set of functional requirements.

1. Create a new React CodeSandbox project and name it **"React Todo List."**
2. Follow the requirements below to implement your application.
3. Submit your CodeSandbox link when finished.

The layout and styling are up to you, but ensure your application is neat, functional, and provides a good user experience.

## Deliverables

- A link to your CodeSandbox with the completed application.
- Ensure the app runs without errors.

## Requirements

1. **Todo List Functionality**:
   - Add a heading labeled "Todo List."
   - Create a list of todos. Each todo should include:
     - A checkbox to mark it as complete.
     - A delete button (disabled unless the todo is marked complete).
     - An edit button to replace the todo with a text input for editing.
     - A save button to save changes when editing is active.
  
2. **Create New Todos**:
   - Provide an input field for users to add new todos to the list.
   - New todos should appear at the top of the list, while older ones stay at the bottom.
